# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,author,createdAt,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Search for duplicates**: `gh issue list --state all --search "<terms>" --json number,title,state,labels`.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`. Add `--reason "not planned"` for `wontfix`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Team

Authors whose association is `OWNER`, `MEMBER` or `COLLABORATOR` are the team. Everyone else is external.

External comments: wait

`wait` (default): a skill drafts any comment addressed to an external person and stops for a human. `allow`: skills post such comments on this tracker themselves, with the AI disclaimer. Set `allow` only if unattended runs may talk to reporters.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `ns-triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=open' --jq '.[] | select(.author_association | IN("OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR") | not) | {number, title, author: .user.login, author_association, labels: [.labels[].name]}'`.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either: resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Audit

audit issues per run: 5

The most issues one `ns-agent-readiness` run files. With no such line, it files 5.

## Linking issues

- **Sub-issue of a parent**: `gh issue create --parent <parent> ...`, or `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>`. Without sub-issues, put `Part of #<parent>` at the top of the child body.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's native issue dependencies. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). Where dependencies aren't available, put a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body.
- **Is it unblocked?** Count open blockers: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/dependencies/blocked_by --jq '[.[] | select(.state == "open")] | length'`. Zero means unblocked. `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` keeps counting a blocker after it closes, so it can't gate.
