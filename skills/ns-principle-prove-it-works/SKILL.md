# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Proxies, self-reports, and "it compiles" are not evidence.

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

Check the real thing, not a proxy:
- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

**Firmware:** a host test or simulator pass is a proxy for the board. When the change touches hardware behavior, prove it on target (flash, drive it over serial, read the register, capture the bus), or report the result as `inconclusive`.

## Script the check when you can

The strongest proof is a deterministic script that re-runs the same comparison, not a one-time eyeball. Write the script, run it, and keep its output as an artifact a reviewer can re-run instead of trusting your word.

Record the command, the output that proves it, and where any log or capture was saved. The `ns-verify` skill writes this to the unit's `evidence.md`. Commit the script only for large or complex work where the trail has to be auditable later, like a big port or migration.
